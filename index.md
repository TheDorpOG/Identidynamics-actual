# Identidynamics

Welcome to the official repository of **Identidynamics**, a speculative physics framework authored by Mihai “Dorp”.

Identidynamics reimagines particle identity as a product of electromagnetic field translation. Quarks act as binary logic gates, and composite particles emerge from their configuration. This site hosts the paper, simulation code, and future expansions.
