## 🔬 Core Concepts

- Quarks as binary logic gates
- Identity as electromagnetic translation
- Composite particles as emergent configurations
- Field interactions as identity shifts

---

## 🧠 Author's Note

This theory is not a conclusion.  
It’s an invitation to rethink what a particle is, what identity means, and why the universe might be a programmable hallucination.
