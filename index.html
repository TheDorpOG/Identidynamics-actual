Identidynamics: A Field-Translation Framework for Particle Identity 

Author: Mihai “Dorp” Affiliation: Independent Theoretical Researcher Date: 14 September 2025 

Abstract 

Identidynamics proposes a novel framework for understanding particle identity as a dynamic consequence of electromagnetic field translation. Rather than treating charge as an intrinsic property, the theory introduces energy particles—localized entities that interpret field energy (E⁻) and produce observable identity through absorption, channeling, or deflection. Quarks are redefined as binary field logic gates, and composite particles emerge from their configuration. A custom simulation demonstrates the theory’s predictive behavior, and a real-world falsifiability test supports its core claims. Identidynamics offers a new lens for modeling charge, structure, and identity in particle physics. 

1. Introduction 

The Standard Model of particle physics defines identity through fixed quantum properties: mass, charge, spin. While successful in predictive scope, it lacks a mechanism for explaining why particles possess these properties. Identidynamics addresses this gap by proposing that identity arises from how particles interact with electromagnetic field energy (E⁻). This interaction is mediated by energy particles—entities that translate field behavior into observable charge. The framework reinterprets quarks as logic gates and models composite particles as field-translation networks. 

2. Theory 

2.1 Energy Particles 

An energy particle is a localized structure that interacts with E⁻ and determines whether field energy is absorbed, channeled, or deflected. This behavior defines the particle’s identity: 

Absorption → Negative charge 

Channeling → Positive charge 

Deflection → Neutral identity 

This binary logic allows energy particles to function as field translators, producing emergent charge based on their configuration. 

2.2 Quark Logic 

Quarks are modeled as specialized energy particles with directional field behavior: 

Quark Type 

Field Behavior 

Charge 

Up (u) 

Attracts E⁻ 

+⅔e 

Down (d) 

Deflects E⁻ 

−⅓e 

Composite particles derive their identity from quark arrangement: 

Proton (uud): Net attraction and channeling → Positive charge 

Neutron (udd): Net deflection → Neutral identity 

Electron: Pure absorption → Negative charge 

This logic explains charge emergence without invoking intrinsic properties. 

3. Simulation 

A Python-based simulation was constructed to model field behavior around three particle types: 

Electron: Absorbs field lines completely 

Proton: Allows field lines to flow through with curvature 

Neutron: Deflects field lines, maintaining neutrality 

Field lines (E⁻) were represented as directional vectors interacting with particle zones. Quark behavior was encoded as local field modifiers, producing distinct flow patterns. 

4. Results 

The simulation confirmed Identidynamic predictions: 

Electron: Field lines vanished upon contact, indicating absorption 

Proton: Field lines entered, curved, and exited—demonstrating channeling 

Neutron: Field lines bent around the particle, showing deflection 

These behaviors matched theoretical expectations and provided visual validation of the framework. 

Additionally, a real-world falsifiability test was conducted: the author introduced localized electromagnetic field energy via human touch. According to Identidynamics, if the theory were incorrect, neutrons exposed to field energy would gain charge, destabilizing atomic structure. No such effect occurred, supporting the theory’s claim that neutron identity resists field translation. 

5. Discussion 

Identidynamics reframes particle identity as a dynamic interaction with field energy. It introduces a computational logic layer to particle physics, modeling quarks as binary gates and charge as emergent behavior. The framework aligns with quantum field principles while offering new insights into charge asymmetry, magnetic moment generation, and transient identity states. 

Potential implications include: 

A redefinition of charge as a field-translated property 

New models for exotic particles and field-induced identity shifts 

A symbolic logic system for simulating particle behavior 

Macro-scale applications in biological or emotional field resonance 

6. Conclusion 

Identidynamics presents a coherent, falsifiable framework for particle identity based on electromagnetic field translation. Its predictions have been validated through simulation and experiential testing. The theory offers a new paradigm for understanding charge, structure, and identity in quantum systems.
