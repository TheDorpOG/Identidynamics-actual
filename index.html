  <h1>Identidynamix</h1>
  <p><strong>A speculative physics framework by Mihai (aka Dorp)</strong></p>
  <p>Exploring identity through electromagnetic translation, logic gates, and particle configuration.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>📜 Abstract</h2>
    <p>Identidynamix proposes a new framework for understanding identity in physical systems. By treating quarks as binary logic gates and electromagnetic translation as the mechanism of identity, this theory reimagines particles not as static entities but as dynamic configurations of logic and field interaction.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🔬 Core Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Quarks as binary logic gates</li>
      <li>Identity as electromagnetic translation</li>
      <li>Composite particles as emergent configurations</li>
      <li>Field interactions as identity shifts</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🧠 Introduction</h2>
    <p>In traditional physics, particles are defined by mass, charge, and spin. Identidynamix challenges this by suggesting that identity itself is a dynamic property—one that emerges from the translation of electromagnetic states across logic gates embedded in quantum fields.</p>
    <p>This framework does not seek to replace the Standard Model, but to reinterpret its architecture through the lens of computational identity. What if every particle is a program? What if every interaction is a rewrite?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>⚙️ Logic Gate Quarks</h2>
    <p>Quarks are treated as fundamental logic gates—AND, OR, XOR—whose configurations determine the emergent properties of composite particles. The gluon field becomes a carrier of logic state transitions, not just force mediation.</p>
    <p>In this view, hadrons are not merely bound states—they are compiled identities.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>🌌 Field Translation</h2>
    <p>Electromagnetic translation is the process by which identity shifts across space-time. It is not motion, but reinterpretation. A photon does not travel—it reconfigures the logic state of the field it enters.</p>
    <p>This leads to a radical implication: identity is not conserved—it is contextual.</p>

    <h2>📣 Author's Note</h2>
    <blockquote>
      “This theory is not a conclusion. It’s an invitation.”
    </blockquote>
    <p>Identidynamix is a framework for rethinking what a particle is, what identity means, and why the universe might be a programmable hallucination. It is speculative, irreverent, and unapologetically curious.</p>
